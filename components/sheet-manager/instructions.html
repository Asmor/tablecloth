	<p>
		Make a google spreadsheet. Make sure it's published; to do this, go to File -&gt; Publish to Web. Click the blue button that says "Publish". You'll get a popup asking you to confirm; click yes. If you don't get the popup, make sure you don't have popups blocked on google drive.
	</p>

	<p>
		After you publish, just paste the sheet's ID or its URL and give it a name.
	</p>

	<p>
		The format for the spreadsheet is pretty simple, and it's probably easiest to just take a look at <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MBKVa23DHV_PeenD8iv-dAPVfqBqDmZMS5Enfjf73Y0">the sheet I use for the default tables</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		The format is [worksheet name.column header], e.g. "[_martial.adjective]" is taken from the "_martial" worksheet with the column header "adjective". Every option in a column is equally likely.
	</p>

	<p>
		Note that sheets and columns which are prefixed with an underscore, like _martial and Character._fear are hidden. This allows you to have subtables that you don't want to clog up the list of tables!
	</p>

	<p>
		You can roll dice using traditional XdY format, optionally with +, -, or x to add, subtract, or multiply a modifier (e.g. 1d6x1000, 2d10+2, etc).
	</p>

	<p>
		If the first word of a row is a number, that will be assumed to be a weight for that row. Every row has a default weight of 1. You can use the weight to make some entries more or less likely. For example, if your rows were "2 apple" and "orange", apple (weight of 2) would be twice as common as orange (default weight of 1). You can also use up to 1 decimal place to make results less likely, e.g. if "0.1 durian" was on that same table it would be a tenth as common as oranges and a twentieth as common as apples.
