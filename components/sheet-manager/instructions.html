	<h1>Instructions</h1>

	<p>
		Make a google spreadsheet. Make sure it's published; to do this, go to File -&gt; Publish to Web. Click the blue button that says "Publish". You'll get a popup asking you to confirm; click yes. If you don't get the popup, make sure you don't have popups blocked on google drive.
	</p>

	<p>
		After you publish, just grab the ID of the sheet. It's the long string of random gibberish in the middle of the URL. For example, the default sheet's url is https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<b>1MBKVa23DHV_PeenD8iv-dAPVfqBqDmZMS5Enfjf73Y0</b> and its ID is the bolded part.
	</p>

	<p>
		The format for the spreadsheet is pretty simple, and it's probably easiest to just take a look at <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MBKVa23DHV_PeenD8iv-dAPVfqBqDmZMS5Enfjf73Y0">the sheet I use for the default tables</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		The format is [worksheet name.column header], e.g. "[_martial.adjective]" is taken from the "_martial" worksheet with the column header "adjective". Every option in a column is equally likely.
	</p>

	<p>
		Note that sheets and columns which are prefixed with an underscore, like _martial and Character._fear are hidden. This allows you to have subtables that you don't want to clog up the list of tables!
